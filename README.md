# mastermind

This is an implementation of the classic Mastermind game. The player must guess the colors (out of six possibilities) in order of four hidden pegs generated by the computer. For each color that the player guesses correctly, a black peg is placed next to that row on the board. If the player guesses the correct color in the wrong location, a while peg is placed. The player has 12 turns to guess all four colors in their correct locations.
